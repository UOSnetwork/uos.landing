            <div>Delegated-Proof-of-Importance (DPoI) consensus algorithm integrates the concepts of Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) and Network Theory. The algorithm can calculate the network participant’s importance based on other participants’ evaluation. The algorithm considers and ranks their stake and incoming transaction activity, including both transfer and social activities.</br></br>
            Social and economic interaction of U°OS network participants is evaluated by others thus creating importance (i.e. reputation on the network). The interactions are expressed in transactions recorded in blocks of U°OS blockchain by block-producers. Block-producers are elected by U°OS network participants with non-zero importance. Calculator nodes. are dedicated to calculating transfer and social activity indices of every account on the U°OS network. Calculator nodes are community-owned and receive a regular emission of UOS tokens.</div>
